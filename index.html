    <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>

    <h2>What is Machine Learning and Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Our topic is <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>, which is a type of artificial intelligence. It helps computers learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being told exactly what to do. This is important because ML is now used in many areas that affect our daily lives, like shopping, healthcare, education, and technology.</p>
    <img src="stockphoto2.jpg" alt="Practical applications of ML" class="inline-image">
    <p>Machine learning is used in places like businesses, schools, hospitals, and media. For example, it can help doctors find signs of disease early, help teachers understand how students are learning, or help apps recommend music or videos. Because of how fast ML is growing, it’s becoming a big part of how people work, learn, and live.</p>

    <h2>Why We Chose This Topic</h2>
    <p>We chose machine learning because it’s one of the most important technologies today. It has grown quickly in just a few years and has changed how people use the internet and technology. Students, teachers, workers, and companies all use ML tools in different ways. But as this powerful technology becomes more common, we also need to think about the problems it can cause—like unfair decisions or misuse of data. That’s why we think it’s important to learn and talk about it.</p>
